# Jin

Jin is a work-in-progress programming language, and is intended to be a general-purpose, compiled and simple.

## Hello, World

```
fn main() =
    println("Hello, World!")
```

## Goals

- Fast enough for most use-cases
- Simple (small surface area)
- Fast compile times

## Usage

There's no real CLI yet, but this is how I'd imagine it to work

Run:

```sh
jin run main.jin
```

Build:

```sh
jin build main.jin
./main
```
