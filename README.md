# Untitled

Untitled is a work-in-progress, and is intended to be a general-purpose, compiled and high level programming language.

## Hello, World

```rust
fn main() =
    println("Hello, World!")
```

## Goals

- Fast enough for most use-cases
- Simple (small surface area)
- Fast compile times

## Usage

There's no real CLI yet, but this is how I'd imagine it to work

```sh
untitled build hello.un
./hello
```
