# Jin

Jin is a statically typed, procedural and safe programming language.

## Hello, World

```
fn main()
    println("Hello, World!")
```

## Highlights

- Deterministic, automatic memory management
- Pattern matching and union types
- Polymorphic types
- Compiled to machine code

## Goals

- Fast enough for use-cases such as servers and cli applications
- Simple and orthogonal
- Fast compile times

## Usage

```sh
jin build main.jin
./main
```
